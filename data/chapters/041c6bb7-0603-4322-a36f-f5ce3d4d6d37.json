  "rawText": " itself  into  something better,  and  to  acquire a  new\nPersonal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes\none thing only.”\nThe sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly.\nThe wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow with\ngreater force, so that the sun would not blind the boy.\n“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will\nsearch for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he\nwas in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no\nfurther need for lead; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold.\n“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to\nbecome better than we are, everything around us becomes better,\ntoo.”\n“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun\nasked the boy.\n“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to\nroam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from\na  distance, like  you  do.  Love  is  the  force  that  transforms and\nimproves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I\nthought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that\nit was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and\nwars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we\nlive  in  will  be  either better or  worse, depending on  whether we\nbecome better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes\nin. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than\nwe are.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.\n“I  want  you  to  help  me  turn  myself into  the  wind,” the  boy\nanswered.\n“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said.\n“But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”\n“Then, whom should I ask?”\nThe sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, and\nwanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its\nlimitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the\nLanguage of the World.\n“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.\nThe wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The\ntents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals\nwere being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at\neach other as they sought to keep from being blown away.\nThe boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed\nthat the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak.\nA current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to\npray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a\nprayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his\nsheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able\nto sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had met\ncontinue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that\nthe desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the\nsigns written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths,\nand to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He\nsaw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space,\nand  that  there was  no  reason  or  significance attached  to  their\nappearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the\nsun, nor people knew why they had been created. But that the hand\nhad a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform\nmiracles, or transform the sea into a desert . . . or a man into the\nwind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design\nthat  had  moved the  universe  to  the  point  at  which six  days  of\ncreation had evolved into a Master Work.\nThe boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it\nwas a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was\n\n\n\n\n\nhis own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.\nThe simum  blew  that  day  as  it  had  never blown before. For\ngenerations thereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who\nhad turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military camp,\nin defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.\nWhen the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place\nwhere the  boy  had  been. But  he  was  no  longer there; he  was\nstanding next  to  a  sand-covered sentinel, on  the  far  side  of  the\ncamp.\nThe men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people\nwho were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect\ndisciple, and  the  chief, because  that  disciple had  understood the\nglory of God.\nThe following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist\nfarewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany them\nas far as they chose.\nThey rode for the entire day. Toward the end of the afternoon, they\ncame upon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told\nthe escorts they could return to the camp.\n“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are\nonly three hours from the Pyramids.”\n“Thank you,” said the boy. “You taught me the Language of the\nWorld.”\n“I only invoked what you already knew.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  alchemist knocked on  the  gate  of  the  monastery.  A  monk\ndressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in\nthe Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter.\n“I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist\nsmiled.\nThey  went  to  the  kitchen at  the  back  of  the  monastery.  The\nalchemist lighted the  fire,  and  the  monk brought him  some lead,\nwhich the  alchemist placed in  an  iron  pan.  When the  lead  had\nbecome liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow\negg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax,\nand added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.\nThe mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color of blood. The\nalchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As\nhe did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.\n“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.\nThe monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza\nfor some time, waiting for the wars to end. “But God’s will be done,”\nthe monk said.\n“Exactly,” answered the alchemist.\nWhen the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it,\ndazzled. The lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no\nlonger lead. It was gold.\n“Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.\n“This was  my  Personal Legend, not  yours,” the  alchemist\nanswered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”\nThey returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the alchemist\nseparated the disk into four parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk.\n“It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”\n“But  this  payment goes  well  beyond my  generosity,”  the  monk\nresponded.\n“Don’t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the\nnext time.”\nThe alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for\nwhat you gave to the general.”\nThe boy was about to say that it was much more than he had\ngiven the general. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the\nalchemist said to the monk.\n“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts.\n“Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.”\nHe took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.\n“This is for the boy. If he ever needs it.”\n“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very\nclose to it now.”\n“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.\n“Then why this?”\n“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the\nthief, and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I\nbelieve in  our  proverbs. There’s  one  that  says, ‘Everything that\nhappens once can never happen again. But everything that happens\ntwice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.\n“I want to tell you a story about dreams,” said the alchemist.\nThe boy brought his horse closer.\n“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a\ngood man who had two sons. One was in the military, and had been\nsent to the most distant regions of the empire. The other son was a\npoet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.\n“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him,\nand told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and\nrepeated throughout the world for all generations to come. The father\nwoke from his dream grateful and crying, because life was generous,\n\n\n\n\n\nand had revealed to him something any father would be proud to\nknow.\n“Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child who\nwas about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had\nlived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he went\ndirectly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared in his\ndream.\n“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived\nyour life in a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you\nany wish you desire.’\n“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my\ndream, I  felt  that  all  my  efforts  had  been  rewarded, because my\nson’s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don’t\nwant anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame\nachieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and educated as\nhe grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my\nson’s words.’\n“The  angel touched the  man’s  shoulder,  and  they  were  both\nprojected far  into  the  future.  They  were  in  an  immense  setting,\nsurrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language.\n“The man wept with happiness.\n“‘I knew that my son’s poems were immortal,’ he said to the angel\nthrough his tears. ‘Can you please tell me which of my son’s poems\nthese people are repeating?’\n“The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him\nto a bench nearby, where they sat down.\n“‘The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in\nRome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But\nwhen the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The\nwords you’re hearing now are those of your son in the military.’\n“The man looked at the angel in surprise.\n“‘Your  son  went  to  serve at  a  distant place, and  became a\ncenturion. He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants\nfell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a\nrabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and\ndays in search of this man. Along the way, he learned that the man\nhe was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been\n\n\n\n\n\ncured by him, and they instructed your son in the man’s teachings.\nAnd  so,  despite the  fact  that  he  was  a  Roman centurion, he\nconverted to  their  faith.  Shortly  thereafter,  he  reached  the  place\nwhere the man he was looking for was visiting.’\n“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the\nrabbi made ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was\na man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that\nhe was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’\n“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These\nare the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never\nbeen  forgotten: “My  Lord,  I  am  not  worthy that  you  should come\nunder my  roof.  But  only  speak a  word  and  my  servant will  be\nhealed.” ’”\nThe alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on\nearth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he\ndoesn’t know it.”\nThe boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life\nwould be of such importance to a shepherd.\n“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.\n“Good-bye,” said the boy.\nThe boy rode along through the desert for several hours, listening\navidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell\nhim where his treasure was hidden.\n“Where your  treasure is,  there also  will  be  your  heart,” the\nalchemist had told him.\nBut his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the\nstory of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had\non two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the\nmany men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful\nwomen, confronting the people of their times with their preconceived\nnotions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.\nAs he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered,\n“Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where\nI am, and that’s where your treasure is.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the\nstarry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.\nThe  moonlight cast  shadows through the  dunes, creating the\nappearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that\nhorse had  reared in  the  desert, and  he  had  come to  know the\nalchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s\njourney in search of treasure.\nWhen he  reached the  top  of  the  dune, his  heart  leapt. There,\nilluminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert,\nstood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.\nThe boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making\nhim believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a\nking, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all\nfor his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love\nwould never keep a man from his Personal Legend.\nIf  he  wanted to,  he  could now  return to  the  oasis, go  back  to\nFatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist\ncontinued to  live  in  the  desert,  even  though he  understood the\nLanguage of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold.\nHe didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The\nboy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal\nLegend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced\neverything he might have dreamed of.\nBut  here  he  was,  at  the  point  of  finding his  treasure, and  he\nreminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has\nbeen achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw\nthat,  where his  tears  had  fallen, a  scarab beetle was  scuttling\nthrough the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that,\nin Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.\nAnother omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so,\nhe thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone\n\n\n\n\n\ncould build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that\nhe couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.\nThroughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but\nfound nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since\nthe  Pyramids had  been  built.  But  he  didn’t stop.  He  struggled to\ncontinue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand\nback into the excavation. His hands we",
