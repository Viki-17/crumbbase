  "rawText": "et, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the\nother hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are\ntrying to realize their Personal Legend.\nHe left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t\nwant to cry with the other people there. He was going to miss the\nplace and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident\nin himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.\n“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my\nflock again.” He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no\nlonger happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to\nmake a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was\nbecoming less  important. Maybe because that  wasn’t really his\ndream.\nWho knows . . . maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant:\nnever go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he\nthought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and\nThummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and\nwill of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the\nboy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day\n\n\n\n\n\nthere. The thief wasn’t there, and the owner brought him a cup of\ntea.\nI  can  always go  back  to  being  a  shepherd, the  boy  thought. I\nlearned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s\ndone. But  maybe I’ll  never  have  another chance to  get  to  the\nPyramids in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he\nknew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.\nThe hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an\nentire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that\nthere was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two\nhours closer  to  his  treasure .  .  .  the  fact  that  the  two  hours had\nstretched into an entire year didn’t matter.\nI  know why  I  want  to  get  back  to  my  flock, he  thought. I\nunderstand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be\ngood friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a\nfriend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I\ndon’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and\nall the time I need. Why not?\nHe suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to\nbeing a  shepherd. He  could  always become a  crystal salesman\nagain. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a\ndream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just\nanyone!\nHe was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one\nof the crystal merchant’s suppliers transported his crystal by means\nof caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in\nhis hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the\nway to his treasure.\n“I  am  always nearby,  when  someone wants to  realize their\nPersonal Legend,” the old king had told him.\nWhat could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find\nout if the Pyramids were really that far away?\nThe Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of\nanimals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never\n\n\n\n\n\nthought I’d  end  up  in  a  place like  this,  he  thought, as  he  leafed\nthrough the pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university,\nand here I am in a corral.\nBut he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all\nhis  studies were  aimed at  finding the  one  true  language  of  the\nuniverse. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions,\nand  now  it  was  alchemy.  He  knew  how  to  speak Esperanto, he\nunderstood all  the  major religions well,  but  he  wasn’t yet  an\nalchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions,\nbut his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not\nseem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an\nalchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only\nabout themselves, and  almost  always refused to  help  him.  Who\nknows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master\nWork—the Philosopher’s  Stone—and for  this  reason kept  their\nknowledge to themselves.\nHe had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father,\nfruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent enormous\namounts of  time  at  the  great  libraries of  the  world, and  had\npurchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In\none he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist\nhad visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred\nyears old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and\nthe Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by\nthe story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth,\nhad not a friend of his—returning from an archaeological expedition\nin  the  desert—told him  about an  Arab  that  was  possessed of\nexceptional powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people\nsay that he is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any\nmetal into gold.”\nThe Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all\nhis  commitments and  pulled  together the  most  important of  his\nbooks, and  now  here  he  was,  sitting inside a  dusty,  smelly\nwarehouse. Outside, a  huge  caravan was  being prepared for  a\ncrossing of  the  Sahara, and  was  scheduled to  pass  through Al-\nFayoum.\nI’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought.\nAnd the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.\nA  young  Arab, also  loaded  down with  baggage, entered, and\ngreeted the Englishman.\n“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.\n“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his\nreading. He  didn’t want  any  conversation at  this  point. What  he\nneeded to do was review all he had learned over the years, because\nthe alchemist would certainly put him to the test.\nThe young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book\nwas written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He\nspoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-\nFayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no\nother important things to do.\n“That’s strange,” said the boy, as he tried once again to read the\nburial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to\nread this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even\nwithout a  king  to  provide an  interruption, he  was  unable to\nconcentrate.\nHe still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he\nwas able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the\nbeginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really\ndiving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never\ndreamed of when he first made the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I’d\nwind  up  working in  a  crystal  shop, he  thought. And  joining this\ncaravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to\nbe a mystery to me.\nNearby was  the  Englishman, reading a  book. He  seemed\nunfriendly, and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They\nmight even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the\nconversation.\nThe boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do anything\nthat might make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and\nThummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.\nThe stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”\nIn a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.\n“They’re not for sale,” he said.\n“They’re not  worth much,” the  Englishman answered. “They’re\nonly made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in\nthe earth. But those who know about such things would know that\nthose are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in\nthis part of the world.”\n“They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.\nThe stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket,\nand took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.\n“Did you say a king?” he asked.\n“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like\nme, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.\n“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king\nthat  the  rest  of  the  world refused to  acknowledge. So,  it’s  not\nsurprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”\nAnd he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he\nwas talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught me\nabout Urim  and  Thummim. These stones were  the  only  form  of\ndivination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden\nbreastplate.”\nThe boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.\n“Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.\n“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing\nby the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing\nthe  journal he  was  reading. “There is  a  universal language,\nunderstood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of\nthat universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I\nhave to  find  a  man  who  knows that  universal language. An\nalchemist.”\nThe conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.\n“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan\nleaving today for Al-Fayoum.”\n“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.\n“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are\nyou?”\n“That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat Arab\nhad gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just about the\nwords luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the universal\nlanguage is written.”\nHe told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with\nUrim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too,\nwere in search of the alchemist.\n“I’m  looking  for  a  treasure,” said  the  boy,  and  he  immediately\nregretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach\nany importance to it.\n“In a way, so am I,” he said.\n“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when\nthe warehouse boss called to them to come outside.\n“I’m the leader of the caravan,” said a dark-eyed, bearded man. “I\nhold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. The\ndesert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.”\nThere were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four\nhundred animals—camels, horses, mules, and  fowl.  In  the  crowd\nwere women, children, and a number of men with swords at their\nbelts  and  rifles  slung on  their  shoulders. The  Englishman had\nseveral suitcases filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and\n\n\n\n\n\nthe  leader  had  to  repeat himself several times for  everyone to\nunderstand what he was saying.\n“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own\nGod. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I\nwill do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But\nI want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in\nthat  you  will  follow my  orders no  matter what. In  the  desert,\ndisobedience means death.”\nThere was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly\nto  his  or  her  own  God.  The  boy  swore to  Jesus Christ. The\nEnglishman said  nothing. And  the  murmur lasted longer than  a\nsimple vow would have. The people were also praying to heaven for\nprotection.\nA long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up.\nThe  boy  and  the  Englishman had  bought camels, and  climbed\nuncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’s\ncamel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.\n“There’s  no  such  thing  as  coincidence,” said  the  Englishman,\npicking up  the  conversation  where it  had  been  interrupted in  the\nwarehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who\n. . .”\nBut the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear\nwhat the Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about\nto  describe, though: the  mysterious chain that  links  one  thing  to\nanother, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd,\nthat had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city\nnear Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal\nmerchant, and . . .\nThe closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more\nthat Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the\n\n\n\n\n\nboy.\nThe  caravan moved toward  the  east.  It  traveled during the\nmorning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late\nin the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who\nspent most of his time with his books.\nThe  boy  observed in  silence the  progress of  the  animals and\npeople across the desert. Now everything was quite different from\nhow it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion\nand shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all\nmixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.\nBut, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind,\nand of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little\nto one another.\n“I’ve  crossed these sands many  times,” said  one  of  the  camel\ndrivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so\ndistant, that  they  make a  person feel  small, and  as  if  he  should\nremain silent.”\nThe boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever\nhaving set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a\nfire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.\nI’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from\ncrystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It\nseems old and wise.\nThe wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had\nsat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It\nreminded him of the wool from his sheep . . . his sheep who were\nnow  seeking food  and  water in  the  fields of  Andalusia, as  they\nalways had.\n“They’re not  my  sheep anymore,” he  said  to  himself, without\nnostalgia. “They  must  be  used  to  their  new  shepherd, and  have\nprobably already forgotten me.  That’s  good. Creatures like  the\nsheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”\nHe thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had\nprobably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who\ncould read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably\nwasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding\nof  the  camel driver’s  comment:  maybe he  was  also  learning the\n\n\n\n\n\nuniversal language that deals with the past and the present of all\npeople. “Hunches,”  his  mother used  to  call  them. The  boy  was\nbeginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of\nthe soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all\npeople are connected, and we are able to know everything, because\nit’s all written there.\n“Maktub,” ",
